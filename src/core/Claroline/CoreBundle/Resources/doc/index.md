# Development documentation

This documentation covers the architecture of the Claroline platform, of its core and
its plugin system. It also includes information on best practices and references to
useful external resources. It doesn't cover the topics of the installation nor the
development requirements. For these matters, you can see the main [readme][readme_path]
file.
